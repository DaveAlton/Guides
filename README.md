# Guides

##I would have liked to accomplish:
1. A loading indicator when fetching events
2. Proper error handling
3. Testing to ensure that events and dates are sorted and filled properly in GuidesViewModel
4. Use Result<Void, Error> in fetchEvents to deliver proper error handling to the ViewController. Same for sort(events:)
5. Better styling. It's currently not a very pretty design. Adding images and better arrangements could make it look way better.
